# Currency Converter Web App (JavaScript Project)

## Project Overview
A simple and interactive **JavaScript-based web application** that converts currency values in real time using live exchange rates. The project focuses on working with external APIs, handling asynchronous data, and updating the UI dynamically.

## Description
This is a **pure JavaScript project** that allows users to convert an entered amount from one currency to another using up-to-date exchange rate data. The application dynamically updates currency values and displays the corresponding country flags based on the selected currencies.

The project demonstrates practical JavaScript usage, including API consumption, asynchronous operations, DOM manipulation, and input validation—all without using any backend.

## What It Does
- Convert currency values in real time
- Fetch live exchange rates from an external API
- Update country flags dynamically based on selected currencies
- Validate user input before conversion

## Features
- Built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**
- Real-time currency conversion using live exchange rates
- Automatic country flag updates
- Responsive and user-friendly design
- Client-side input validation
- No backend or server required

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (core project language)
- HTML
- CSS
- External Exchange Rate API

## JavaScript Concepts Practiced
- Fetch API and asynchronous programming
- Promises and async/await
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Input validation
- Working with external APIs

## Project Purpose
This project was created to **strengthen JavaScript fundamentals** by working with real-world data and APIs. It serves as a practical foundation for more advanced projects and future **React-based applications**.
